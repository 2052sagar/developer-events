==== MapML

To make MapML more appealing to developers of server-side software, there should be consideration of how to enable MapML to consume the JSON-based payloads that are described in the OGC API family of standards rather than requiring them to be re-encoded in `text/mapml`. This could be an area for future development in a code sprint or other OGC initiative.
