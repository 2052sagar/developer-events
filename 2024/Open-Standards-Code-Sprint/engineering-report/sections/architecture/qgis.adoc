==== QGIS

The https://www.qgis.org/[QGIS] stable release V3.28.6-Firenze, and later versions, has a Time Slider/Controller added to the menu bar. It behaves like a video controller if relevant to the data being displayed. 

This and https://www.qgis.org/download/[later versions] also support the OGC API-EDR queries via a plugin.

Release V3.37 and https://www.qgis.org/download/[later] now supports a Vertical Slider for data and layers that have a vertical extent.

During this code sprint, the support for OGC API in QGIS using the GDAL/OGR driver was tested.

The current status (using QGIS version 3.39.0-Master QGIS code revision 399f7df and GDAL/OGR version 3.10.0dev-1b32f9f6cf-dirty) is:
* OGC API - Features is not working as expected, as described on this https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/58087[issue].
* OGC API - Tiles is also not working, and it seems to be a QGIS issue, rather than a GDAL issue, so it is worth filing another issue in the QGIS repository.
