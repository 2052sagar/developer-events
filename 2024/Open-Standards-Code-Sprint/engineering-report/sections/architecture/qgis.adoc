The stable release V3.28.6-Firenze has a Time Slider/Cntroller added to the menu bar. It behaves like a video controller if relevant to the data being displayed. 

This and later versions also support the OGC API-EDR queries via a plugin.

A later release, V3.37, now supports a Vertical Slider for data and layers that have a vertical extent.
