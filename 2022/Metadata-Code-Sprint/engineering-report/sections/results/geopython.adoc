=== Geopython stack

The GeoPython suite of tooling was integrated and demonstrated as part of a Mentor Stream during the code sprint in order to demonstrate end-to-end metadata lifecycle management.

* pygeometa: create / manage metadata from simple YAML configurations, exporting to numerous metadata formats
* OWSLib: publish metadata via OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete to an OGC API - Records server
* pygeoapi: serve published metadata via OGC API - Records
* pycsw: serve published metadata via OGC API - Records
* QGIS: use QGIS' MetaSearch capability to discover resources via OGC API - Records

A screenshot from the mentor session is shown in the figure below.
