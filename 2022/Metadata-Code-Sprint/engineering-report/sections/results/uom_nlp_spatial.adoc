=== University of Manchester Natural Language Processing for Spatial Analysis

The team from the University of Manchester implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit for conducting spatial analysis. The toolkit was configured to ingest feature data represented as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection. The team experimented with the use of OGC API - Features for serving feature data to an implementation of the Leaflet client application. A screenshot showing the toolkit is presented in <<img_uom_nlp>>.
