[[GeMPlus-CREAF]]
==== GeM+
GeM+ is a desktop application developed in C for managing and editing geospatial metadata.
The participants from CREAF have worked on the implementation of an OGC API Record client integrated into GeM+.
The implemented prototype of GeM+ is able to read metadata in XML format according to ISO 19115 (ISO 19139) and ISO 19115-2 by connecting to OGC API Records.
The following figures show several screenshots of the implementation in GeM+.
