==== Transactions support

The pycsw project implemented capability for metadata transactions following the OGC API - Records - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete draft specification.  Support for the "Requirements Class "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class was https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/pull/781[implemented], in review and expected to be included in the main codebase. The functionality leverages pycsw's existing underlying transactional support made available by CSW-T. As a result, pycsw implementations are now able to provide OGC API based transactional support for metadata management via OGC API - Records.

A screenshot of the associated OpenAPI/Swagger interface from the implementation is shown in the figure below.

==== OGC Testbed-18 instance of pycsw

An instance of pycsw, implemented for Testbed-18, was included in the code sprint to support a demonstration of asynchronous catalogues that implement OGC API - Records.
