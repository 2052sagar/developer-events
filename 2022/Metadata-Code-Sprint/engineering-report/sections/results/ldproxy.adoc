=== ldproxy

Before the Code Sprint, ldproxy supported the draft version of JSON-FG from January 2022. 

In the Code Sprint, the implementation was updated by the participants from interactive instruments to support version 0.1, released just before the Code Sprint. In addition, support for the Polyhedron geometry type and for the `compatibility=geojson` media type parameter was adeed.

The updated software was deployed on two servers for use by other participants:

* The main demonstration deployment of ldproxy (demo.ldproxy.net), which includes among others the Ordnance Surface Zoomstack dataset.
* A deployment from Testbed 18 with CityGML building data from the City of Montreal.

A screenshot from the demo.ldproxy.net deployment is shown in the figure below.

The following examples illustrate the differences in responses depending on the request parameters:

[#ldproxy-geojson-example]
.Request three airports as GeoJSON
====
The request fetches three airports as GeoJSON in the default coordinate reference system WGS 84 longitude/latitude:

[source,sh]
----
curl "https://demo.ldproxy.net/zoomstack/collections/airports/items?limit=3" -H "accept: application/geo+json" -o demo.geo.json 
----

The response consists of the standard GeoJSON response with additional members in the feature collection object specified by OGC API Features ("numberReturned" and "timeStamp"):

[source,json]

    "numberReturned": 3,

[#ldproxy-jsonfg-example]
.Request three airports as JSON-FG
====
The request requests three airports as JSON-FG in the default coordinate reference system WGS 84 longitude/latitude:

[source,sh]
----
curl "https://demo.ldproxy.net/zoomstack/collections/airports/items?limit=3" -H "accept: application/vnd.ogc.fg+json" -o demo.fg.json 
----

The response adds the following information to the feature collection object: The "coordRefSys" member with the identifier of the coordinate reference system (WGS 84 lon/lat) as well as the "geometryDimension" to signal to parsing clients that all features have a point geometry. 

The geometry is still encoded in the "geometry" member from GeoJSON since it is in WGS84 longitude/latitude and one of the Simple Feature geometries supported by GeoJSON (points). The "place" member required by JSON-FG is added and set to `null`.

The airport features have no temporal information, the required "time" member is therefore set to `null`.
