=== pygeoapi

The pygeoapi project implemented capability for metadata transactions following the OGC API - Records - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete draft specification.  Support for the "Requirements Class "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class was https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/984[implemented], reviewed and approved by the pygeoapi development team. As a result, pygeoapi implementations are now able to easily define "editable" resources for metadata (OGC API - Records) as well as data (OGC API - Features) thanks to the building block approach of OGC APIs.

The https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/transactions.html[official pygeoapi documentation] provides more information on how to enable the new functionality. A screenshot of the associated OpenAPI/Swagger interface from the implementation is shown in the figure below.

pygeoapi also added support for STAC-based link relations (`+rel=root+`) in support of interoperability with STAC tooling.
