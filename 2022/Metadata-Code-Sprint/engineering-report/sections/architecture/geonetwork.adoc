==== OSGeo GeoNetwork

https://geonetwork-opensource.org[GeoNetwork] is a catalog application for managing spatially referenced resources. It provides metadata editing and search functions as well as an interactive web map viewer.

GeoNetwork is used for (meta)-data management by governments, local communities and private sector. It is also used to discover geospatial (and other) (open) data supporting multiple metadata standards and multiple catalog interfaces.

OGC standards have been core to the GeoNetwork project and the community is now working on the implementation of the OGC API Records specification.
