This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the main achievements of the Joint OGC and ISO Code Sprint, conducted between September 14th and 16th, 2022. Sponsored by Ordnance Survey (OS) and Geonovum, the code sprint was hosted by the OGC and ISO with the goal of advancing the development and implementation open standards that relate to geospatial metadata and catalogues.

A Code Sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints to support the development of new applications and open standards. Code Sprints experiment with emerging ideas in the context of geospatial standards, help improve interoperability of existing standards by experimenting with new extensions or profiles, and are used for building proofs of concept to support standards development activities and enhancement of software products.
