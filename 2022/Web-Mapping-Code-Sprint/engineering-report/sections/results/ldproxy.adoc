=== ldproxy

Sprint participants from interactive instruments GmbH updated ldproxy's implementation of _OGC API - Tiles_ and _OGC API - Styles_.

==== OGC API - Tiles

The participants from interactive instruments GmbH updated their OS Zoomstack demonstration server to support the released version of _OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core_ standard. Specifically, ldproxy now offers a link that can be followed to get to a tile matrix set definition. The link is provided through a `uri` property as shown in the following listing.

==== OGC API - Styles

The ldproxy demonstration implementation of OGC API - Styles was updated with additional styles during the code sprint. The demo server provided a reference for other participants to validate their implementations by. A screenshot a listing of styles offered by the ldproxy demo is shown in <<img_ldproxy_styles>> (a) and metadata about a single style is demonstrated in <<img_ldproxy_styles>> (b).

The work on OGC API - Styles during the code sprint led to a https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-styles/pull/42[pull request] being created to update the candidate standard. The pull request clarifies how to apply changes to a style with multiple occurrences in an API.
