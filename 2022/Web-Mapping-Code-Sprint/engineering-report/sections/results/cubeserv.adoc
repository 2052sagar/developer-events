=== MariaDB CubeWerx CubeSERV

Developers from MariaDB configured an instance of their CubeSERV product to offer an OGC API - Maps interface in front of a WMS that was serving EuroGeographics's EuroRegionalMap. A screenshot of the CubeSERV user interface is shown in <<img_cubeserv>>. The user interface lists the coordinate reference systems that are supported by the collection that is being retrieved.
