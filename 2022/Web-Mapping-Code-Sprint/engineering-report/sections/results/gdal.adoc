==== OGC API - Maps and OGC API - Tiles implementation

The GDAL library project implemented support for the _OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core_ Standard and the _OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core_ candidate Standard.

This library capability enables support for those Standards in QGIS.

During the sprint, participants tested this capability and discovered that following changes to the Standard, the GDAL functionality no longer worked with the latest implementations.
An issue was filed with GDAL about this problem https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/6832 .

Several of the problems were quickly resolved by the GDAL maintainer.
However, issues pertaining to changes in version 2.0 of the _2D Tile Matrix Set_ Standard remain to be addressed, for which a separate issue was filed: https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/6882 .

In addition, participants noted that the QGIS interface to add an OGC API data source to a project is currently a very counter-intuitive hidden capability, requiring to select the "File" option
from "Layer > Add Vector/Raster Layer" and prefixing an OGC API landing or collection URL by "OGCAPI:".
Users could never figure out the procedure (which is also not explained in the documentation) by themselves.
Participants suggested that a more intuitive "Layer > Add OGC API layer..." menu item (covering all OGC API access mechanisms) be added to QGIS in a future version.
Details were added to this QGIS issue about supporting OGC APIs: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/50296 .
