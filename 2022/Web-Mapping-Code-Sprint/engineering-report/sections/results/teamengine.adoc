=== TEAM Engine

The focus of work related to TEAM Engine was on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-ogcapi-tiles10[OGC CITE executable test suite (ETS) OGC API - Tiles].

The work was structured according to the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-ogcapi-tiles10/issues[GitHub issues] related to the ETS. In total, five issues were worked on as part of the code sprint. The following screenshot summarizes those issues.

The team, which consisted of personnel from lat/lon, refactored the ETS so that the executable tests are closer to the structure of the abstract test suite of the standard. Afterwards, the test implementation of the Core conformance class was enhanced. This included the parsing of the OpenAPI document which is required to extract parameters needed to build requests. The parsing of the OpenAPI document is also part of the Tilesets List conformance class. In addition, an already reported bug was solved.

The result can be summarized by a screenshot of a sample HTML report created by the ETS, running from within TEAM Engine. The report structures the already existing tests into the correct conformance classes and gives an overview of already implemented tests.
