==== OGC API – Tiles updates

A previous OpenLayers release had 'experimental' support for rendering tiles from OGC API – Tiles implementations. This was added prior to the OGC API – Tiles Standard being finalized.

:vector-example: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/ogc-vector-tiles.html

During the sprint, the implementation was tested against services conforming to the Tileset conformance class.  Changes were proposed to graduate the source classes for rendering {vector-example}[vector] and {map-example}[map] tiles from 'experimental' to 'stable'.  These changes were approved, and the classes will be part of the OpenLayers API in the next release.
