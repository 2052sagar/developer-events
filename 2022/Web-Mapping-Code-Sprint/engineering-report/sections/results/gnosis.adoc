=== GNOSIS Map Server

A demonstration instance of GNOSIS Map Server was used in the code sprint to support implementation of various client applications, including for example Leaflet which is described in <<results_leaflet>>. GNOSIS Map Server was also used to support the implementation of an Executable Test Suite for OGC API - Tiles, which is described in <<results_team_engine>>.

<<img_gnosis_map_server>> shows a screenshot of the GNOSIS web client (left hand-side) and the responses it is receiving from an instance of GNOSIS Map Server (right hand-side). The interface between the client and server conforms to the OGC API - Tiles Standard. Notice that the responses are individual tiles encoded in the Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) format. MVT is an optional encoding supported by OGC API - Tiles.
