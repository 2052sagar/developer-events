=== Hexagon Luciad RIA

Sprint participants from Hexagon worked on an implementation of their Luciad RIA product. They extended the web client application to support OGC API - Maps. A screenshot of a Hexagon Luciad RIA client application listing collections of maps available from an OGC API - Maps implementation is shown in <<img_luciad_ria_1>>.

The participants also worked on support for re-projection of data and maps on-the-fly. This included the ability to re-project data and maps that have been retrieved from an OGC API - Maps instance into a variety of coordinate reference systems, for example the British National Grid projection (EPSG:27700), as well as several other projections. This capability is demonstrated by the screenshots in <<img_luciad_ria_combined>>.
