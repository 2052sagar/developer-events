==== STAplus Viewer App by Secure Dimensions

The STAplus Viewer App is a proof-of-concept implementation of a web-browser application based on JavaScript (JS) and Leaflet. The implementation further leverages JS libraries from https://github.com/DataCoveEU/API4INSPIRE[STAM] (SensorThings API Map) developed by Datacove for INSPIRE.

The STAplus Viewer App is based on the Leaflet JavaScript library. It is however possible to base the application on OpenLayers. This alternative implementation is available from the https://cos4cloud.secd.eu/staplus-viewer-app/ol.html[COS4Cloud project]. Even though it looks and feels slightly different, both implementations provide the same functionality.
