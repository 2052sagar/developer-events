Ordnance Survey (OS) works with a wide array of customers and partners across many industries in the United Kingdom and beyond. A key part of the current OS Roadmap is the suite of products to deliver the OS National Geographic Database (OS NGD). At the end of September 2022, OS launched the https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs[OS NGD API â€“ Features] product which implements Parts 1, 2, and 3 of OGC API - Features to provide access to data along with filtering capabilities to enable customers to retrieve just the data they need. During the code sprint, developers from OS focuses on implementation of the OGC API - Styles candidate standard. The work at the code sprint complemented other OS activities that are implementing OGC API - Tiles.
