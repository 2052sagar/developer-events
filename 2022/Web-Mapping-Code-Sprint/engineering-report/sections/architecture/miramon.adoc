==== Miramon Map Browser

The Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) deployed an instance of the https://www.miramon.cat/USA/Prod-NavegadorServidor.htm[MiraMon Map Browser] and available in https://github.com/grumets/MiraMonMapBrowser[GitHub]. The MiraMon Map Browser is a web application for creating visualization and analysis solutions that run in modern web browsers. The browser uses HTML5, JavaScript, and supports OGC Standards such as OGC API - Tiles, WMS, and WMTS. The JavaScript client is able to combine AJAX, binary arrays, the WMS/WMTS protocols, the OGC API Maps and the OGC API Tiles. The MiraMon Map Browser has also been extended to support https://docs.ogc.org/bp/21-068.pdf[STAplus], an extension of the OGC SensorThings API standard.
