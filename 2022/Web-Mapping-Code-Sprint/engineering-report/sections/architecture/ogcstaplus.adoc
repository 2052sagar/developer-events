==== OGC STAplus - an extension of the OGC SensorThings API

STAplus is an extension to the OGC SensorThings data model. Inspired by Citizen Science applications, STAplus supports the 'ownership concept' whereby observations collected by sensors are owned by (different) users that may express the license for re-use. In addition to the ownership and license abilities, the extension specified by STAplus supports the expression of explicit relations between observations and the creation of group(s) of observations.
