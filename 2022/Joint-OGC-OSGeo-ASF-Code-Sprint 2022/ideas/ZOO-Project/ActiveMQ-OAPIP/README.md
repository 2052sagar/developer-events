# Use Apache ActiveMQ in replacement of RabbitMQ for asyncrhonous service execution

The [ZOO-Project](http://zoo-project.org) is an Open Source Server Implementation of the [OGC API - Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/).
Here, we propose to investigate the use of [Apache ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) in replacement of the latest RabbitMQ implementation from this [proposal](../RabbitMQ-OAPIP/).

## Resources

* [ZOO-Project OGC API - Processes Demo Instance](https://zooprojectdemo.azurewebsites.net/ogc-api/)
* [CMS Client](https://activemq.apache.org/components/cms/)

## Mentors

The following people will be present in the project room during parts of the code sprint:

* GÃ©rald Fenoy, contributor and PSC Chair of the [ZOO-Project](http://zoo-project.org).


## Requirements

The following steps has been identified to achieve the goal of this effort:

* [Use RabbitMQ for asyncrhonous service execution](../RabbitMQ-OAPIP/)
* Modifying the ZOO-Kernel source code to support the optional use of [Apache ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) in replacement to RabbitMQ.

## Relationship with other Code Sprint projects

This proposal combines [Apache ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) with [ZOO-Project](http://zoo-project.org).
