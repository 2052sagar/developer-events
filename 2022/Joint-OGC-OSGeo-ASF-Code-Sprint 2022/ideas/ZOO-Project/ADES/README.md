# Use latest ZOO-Kernel from the ADES software

The [ZOO-Project](http://zoo-project.org) is an Open Source Server Implementation of the [OGC API - Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/).
Currently, the [ADES software](https://github.com/EOEPCA/proc-ades#about-the-project) is relying on a specific version of the ZOO-Kernel. We would like to take advantage of the code sprint to investigate if it would be possible to use the latest ZOO-Kernel version from the ADES software solution.
