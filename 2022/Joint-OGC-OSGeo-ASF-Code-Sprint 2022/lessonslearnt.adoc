= Immediate Lessons and Next Steps

== Immediate Lessons

* There is concern about the format for presenting attribution of collections and collection metadata. There is a need for some compromise on the attribution format.
* The code sprints provide an opportunity for feedback from more developers within and outside of the OGC and OSGeo community.
* There is a need to always have a bbox response in the HTTP header, to help with determing the extent of the data returned.
* OGC API standards offer an improved developer experience compared to the OGC Web Services suite of standards. 
* The examples in OGC API standards are absolutely key to helping developers to implement the standards.
