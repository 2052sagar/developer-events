=== Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software (GIGS)

The [Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software](https://gigs.iogp.org/) (GIGS) tests
are an [IOGP](https://www.iogp.org/) effort for providing tests for coordinate operations.
GIGS dataset are available as CSV files on [IOGP-GIGS GitHub repository](https://github.com/IOGP-GIGS/GIGSTestDataset).
The aim of this code sprint was to convert the CSV file into implementation-neutral executable tests.
The Apache SIS project has been used for testing the tests, but those tests do not contain any dependency to SIS.

Implementation-neutral tests can be realized by a web service,
and efforts in this direction are already underway at IOGP.
But implementation-neutral tests (or other services) can also be done through programming interfaces.
Web APIs and programming language APIs have both pros and cons not discussed in this report.
But at the time of writing, the only programming language for which an OGC standard API exists is the Java language
(note: it does not imply that implementations must be in Java;
an implementation can be in C/C++ with wrappers such as [PROJ-JNI](https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-JNI)).
API in Python are in development but not yet submitted to OGC SWG.

The executable tests are implemented as JUnit 5 tests and can be executed
by any implementation of [GeoAPI 3.0.1](http://www.geoapi.org/) Java interfaces.
A future version may allow execution of any implementation of Python interfaces
if those interfaces (after completion) are approved as an OGC standard.
The tests can be either integrated in the test suite of a project
(e.g. using Maven, but other build tools work as well),
or be executed by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) shown below.
When using the GUI, user selects in a file browser the JAR file of the library to test.
The implementation entry points are automatically discovered
using the standard `java.util.ServiceLoader` mechanism of the Java platform.
Optional metadata such as implementation name and version
are fetched from the standard `MANIFEST.MF` file bundled in the specified JAR file.

Tests are configurable. Configuration options include:

* Whether names of objects (datum, CRS…) in the implementation are the names defined by EPSG.
* Whether the list of aliases for each object includes at least the aliases defined by EPSG.
* Whether dependencies (e.g. the datum in a CRS) use also the EPSG codes, names and aliases.
* Whether the implementation can still creates objects that have been deprecated by EPSG.
* Whether the implementation has information about which version of a coordinate operation is used.
* And more…

Configuration options can be modified on a case-by-case basis in a project (not yet through the GUI).
In above screenshot where a test was failing because a "Côte d'Ivoire" alias was missing,
it would be possible to disable aliases check only for that particular CRS.
When a test has some disabled checks, the green bar indicating a successful test become shorter.

GIGS tests are divided in series:

* Series 2200 tests the capability of an implementation to build various kind of objects
  (datum, CRS, operation…) from EPSG codes and checks that the object match EPSG definitions.
* Series 3200 tests the capability of an implementation to build various kind of objects
  from custom parameters (not necessarily matching an object from EPSG database).
* Series 5100 tests various coordinate operations (including map projections)
  and checks that the implementation produces the expected values.
* Series 5200 tests various coordinate transformations (including datum shifts)
  and checks that the implementation produces the expected values.
* Series 5300, 5400 and 5500 tests operations with seismic and Wells data.
* Series 7000 checks that some deprecated objects are marked as such.

In this code sprint, we completed all tests of the 2200 series.
Tests of the 3200 series are available from GIGS version 1, but have not yet been ported to version 2.
A little bit of time has been invested in making the GUI test runner more usable.
