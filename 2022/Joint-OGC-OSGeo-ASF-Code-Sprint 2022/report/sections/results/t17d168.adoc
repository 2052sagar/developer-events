=== Extension of the Testbed-17 Dataset testing (D168) prototype

For this code sprint, the prototype's support for OGC API - Records was reviewed.

The OSGeo pygeometa package is used to create the metadata for both the crawlable catalogue Record and individual object Records. The current implementation uses a fork of pygeometa with a new schema for the catalogue versus existing schema for the objects. It was tested whether the existing pygeometa schema could be adjusted to also satisfy the catalogue Record creation.

The maintainers of the prototype deployed catalogues with multiple objects, stored in an AWS S3 bucket, to test various options and support the discussion.
