==== ldproxy

ldproxy is an implementation of the OGC API family of specifications, inspired on the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices. ldproxy is developed by interactive instruments GmbH, written in Java (Source Code) and is typically deployed using docker (DockerHub). The software originally started in 2015 as a Web API for feature data based on WFS 2.0 capabilities. In addition to the JSON/XML encodings, an emphasis is placed on an intuitive HTML representation.

The current version supports WFS 2.0 instances as well as PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases as backends. It implements all conformance classes and recommendations of "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core" and "OGC API - Features- Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems By Reference", as well as the draft extensions (that is Part 3 and Part 4). ldproxy also has draft implementations for additional resource types (Tiles, Styles).
