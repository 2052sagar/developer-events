Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a free and open source software library for developing geospatial applications. The library is an implementation of OGC GeoAPI 3.0.1 interfaces and can be used for desktop or server applications. Services provided by Apache SIS include metadata, coordinate transformations, filtering and grid coverages. The library is implemented using the Java programming language.

In this code sprint, Apache SIS was used for testing the
Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software (GIGS) tests runner.
