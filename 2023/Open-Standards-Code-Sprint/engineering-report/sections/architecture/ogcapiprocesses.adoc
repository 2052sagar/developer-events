==== OGC API - Processes

The https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes[OGC API - Processes]â€‰Standard supports the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application (<<OGC18-062r2>>). The standard enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing the purpose and functionality of the processes. Typically, these processes execute well-defined algorithms that ingest vector and/or coverage data to produce new datasets.
