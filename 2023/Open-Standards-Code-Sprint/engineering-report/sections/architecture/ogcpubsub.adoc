==== OGC Publish/Subscribe extension of OGC API Standards

OGC Web APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on HTTP requests initiated by clients. Clients have to poll APIs for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collection's temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a time, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data updates.
