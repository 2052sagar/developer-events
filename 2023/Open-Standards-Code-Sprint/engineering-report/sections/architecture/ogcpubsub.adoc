==== OGC Publish/Subscribe extension of OGC API Standards

OGC APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collectionâ€™s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a time, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data updates.
