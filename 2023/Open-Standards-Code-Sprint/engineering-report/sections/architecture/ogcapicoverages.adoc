==== OGC API - Coverages

The OGC API - Coverages candidate standard establishes an access mechanism for coverages as defined by the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6 / ISO 19123 Schema for coverage geometry and functions through a Web API which can be described by an API description language such as the OpenAPI specification. Arguably the most popular type of coverage is that of a gridded coverage. Gridded coverages have a grid as their domain set describing the direct positions in multi-dimensional coordinate space, depending on the type of grid. Satellite imagery is typically modeled as a gridded coverage, for example.
