== High-Level Architecture

The focus of the sprint was on the support of implementations of open geospatial standards across various open source software projects. Implementations of approved and candidate OGC Standards were deployed in participantsâ€™ own infrastructure in order to build a solution with the architecture shown below in <<img_architecture>>. As illustrated, the sprint architecture was designed to enable client applications to connect to different servers that implement open geospatial standards. The architecture also included several different software libraries that support open geospatial standards and enable the extraction, transformation, and loading of geospatial data.
