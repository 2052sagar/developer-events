==== GIMI support in the MiraMon Web Browser

Sprint participants from UAB-CREAF worked on the implementation of a web client that can access NGIIS data through files in a GIMI profile or through an OGC Map Web API to show the metadata and display the imagery in a web browser.

===== Accessing GIMI data through a UAB-CREAF web client

They began developing a simple client that is capable through an HEIF file or URL to read the boxes to get the data and metadata to show the timing, the content id, the bounding box and the security information and to display the imagery in a web browser. The client is capable to read HEIF files with JPEG, JPEG200 and HEIC images format.

It use several JavaScript libraries:

*	“mp4box” library to read the HEIF file, construct the boxes and get the items and the data.
*	“vidterra’s” library adapted to a ST0601 Metadata format by Iván Sanchéz during the code sprint to have the metadata information.
*	“opengjpeg” library to have the JP2000 images into an object than they can uses to construct an “ArrayBuffer” to display the image into a canvas.
*	“heic2any” library to convert the HEIC images to a JPEG/PNG format.
They use a native HTML method to display JPEG/PNG images, codifying the image in 64 base in an IMG element.

===== Accessing GIMI data through a MiraMon Web Map Browser

The UAB-CREAF Sprint participants implemented an extension to the MiraMon Web Map Browser that allows access to data in GIMI (HEIF) format from an OGC API Maps server and display and operate with the obtained images.
The map browser connects to an OGC API Maps server with HEIF images and makes the necessary requests to get the images, display, zoom, pan, etc them.
The image in HEIF format following the GIMI profile obtained as a response to each request is converted into a binary array. This allows to display the data in a canvas, choose the symbolization and operate with the data by making calculations, histograms, etc.

They use the OGC API Maps server/web implemented during the code sprint by Jerome Jacovella-St-Louis in https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi.

This is a sample of a map request in HEIF format to the gnosis server:
