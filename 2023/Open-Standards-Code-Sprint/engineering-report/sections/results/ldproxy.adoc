==== ldproxy

Sprint participants from interactive instruments worked on ldproxyâ€™s support of a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) capability for OGC API Standards. This included creation of a  resource using the Topographic Data Store (TDS) schema of the NGA and enabling the resource to support PubSub as well as Create, Replace, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The CRUD capabilities are described in an OpenAPI definition document and the PubSub capabilities are described in an AsyncAPI definition document. Links to both the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI definition documents are clearly visible on the landing page, as shown in Figure TBA.

Below is a fragment of the AsyncAPI definition document created to describe the supported PubSub capability. The fragment shows two of the thirty channels created for monitoring changes on feature collections provided by the API.

The team from interactive instruments also set up a broker for experimenting with the messages. The ldproxy instance offers access to approximately 30 different feature collections. Whenever something is created or changed in a feature collection, a message is sent to the broker. A screenshot showing the channels being monitored through an application called MQTT Explorer is presented in Figure TBA.
