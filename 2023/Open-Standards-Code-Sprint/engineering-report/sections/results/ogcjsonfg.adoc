==== OGC Features and Geometries JSON

A free and open source json-fg-validator[https://github.com/tomkralidis/json-fg-validator] tool was created as an executable test suite
to test JSON FG documents against the ETS requirements.  The initial implementation provides a framework to test and report.  The first pass covered most of the "Core" Requirements Class.

The tool is implemented in Python and contributions are welcome and encouraged.
