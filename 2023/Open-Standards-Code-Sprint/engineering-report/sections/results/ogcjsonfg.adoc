==== OGC Features and Geometries JSON

JSON-FG was approved by the OGC Architecture Board for Public Comments. The JSON-FG team held one breakout during the sprint to answer questions on the specification and provide an overview over changes introduced in the new draft version 0.2.

The following list summarizes JSON-FG-related results achieved during the sprint:

* Participants from Geonovum tested the new JSON-FG driver in GDAL, see <<geonovum_results>> for details.

* A free and open source https://github.com/tomkralidis/json-fg-validator[json-fg-validator] tool was created as an executable test suite to test JSON FG documents against the requirements. The initial implementation provides a framework to test and report. The first pass covered most of the "Core" Requirements Class.

+
The tool is implemented in Python and contributions are welcome and encouraged.

* Development on another https://github.com/Geonovum-labs/json-fg-linter[json-fg-linter] tool was started by Geonovum. The linter rules are based on JSON-FG requirements classes Core, 3D and Features types and Schemas. In addition, the linter does some consistency checks that are useful but not based on explicit requirements.

* An initial version of a https://github.com/Geonovum-labs/json-fg-java[json-fg-java] library was developed by Geonovum. The library aims to make encoding and decoding of JSON-FG documents as easy as possible in Java. The status of the library is experimental. The implementation is compatible with v0.2.1 of the JSON-FG specification.

* A https://ivansanchez.gitlab.io/gleo/demos/jsonfg-drag-drop.html[JSON-FG map client] was deployed by sprint participants that supported viewing JSON-FG documents by drag-and-drop.

* MUDDI data was loaded into MariaDB and published via an OGC Web API, including in JSON-FG; see <<mariadb_results>> for details.

* The ldproxy implementation was updated to JSON-FG version 0.2.1 during the sprint, see <<ldproxy_results>> for details.

One topic during the breakout was support for different coordinate reference systems and the GeoJSON compatibility. Since the sprint took place in London, the British National Grid (EPSG:27700) was used as the coordinate reference system in example requests to an API implementing OGC API Features:

* The <<mariadb_results,MariaDB results section>> includes a "Manhole" feature being presented as JSON-FG using CRS EPSG:27700 as provided from the MariaDB feature server.

* An airport feature from the OS Open Zoomstack dataset in the default coordinate reference system (OGC:CRS84):
