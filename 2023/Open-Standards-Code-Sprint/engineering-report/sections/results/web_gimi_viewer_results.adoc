==== GIMI web-map client

Some of the processing needed to display GIMI imagery in a web browser can be performed on either the server or the client. In the former case, a (web) server has to parse the metadata and decode the image, sending separate pieces of information to the web browser.

In the latter case, the web browser receives the entire ISOBMFF container file, parses the metadata, and extracts and decodes the image.

There is a need to compare both approaches (in terms of flexibility, performance, integrity, etc.), as well as considering hybrid approaches; but no client-only GIMI implementation existed prior to the code sprint. Therefore, sprint participants prototyped a client application, called https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/web-gimi-viewer[web-gimi-viewer], for displaying GIMI imagery. Development of web-gimi-viewer helped to identify a number of issues relating to GIMI.


One of those issues was that there are records of metadata in various parts of a GIMI file, and each record of metadata uses a different encoding. This is illustrated in <<img_gimi_metadata_encodings>>. The four kinds of (meta)data in different encodings therefore require four different tools to be parsed, and thus four different blocks of code (which duplicates effort, cost, and possible software defects).

The ISOBMFF structure of the file is handled with the https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js/[mp4box] library. A few technical issues within this library were discovered and fixed during the code sprint.

Geographical information is currently encoded in KLV conforming to MISB ST 0601, which is a standard for transmitting the attitude and status of an unmanned aerial vehicle via radio link, in real time, to a ground station. This encoding is handled with https://github.com/vidterra/misb.js/[vidterra's misb.js] library, which needed substantial adaptations to work in a web browser.

Instead of KLV+ST0601, it might be preferable to store geographical information directly in the ISOBMFF metadata fields using a WKB (Well-Known Binary) encoding. The non-domain-specific https://geopose.org/[GeoPose] OGC Standard should also be considered. Further research would be needed to explore the technical viability of WKB and/or GeoPose when a GIMI file contains video instead of a single still image. 

Security markings are encoded in a small XML document. While parsing XML in a web browser is trivialized due to built-in functionality, this is not the case in server implementations. Therefore, it will be beneficial to consider ways of implementing Dublin Core and/or ISO 19115-1:2014 metadata alongside, possibly encoded in JSON. 

Atomic time metadata is stored in ISOBMFF metadata fields and is decoded with no need of an external library since its structure is relatively simple.

The simplest version of web-gimi-viewer offers a text dump of all the aforementioned metadata, as shown in <<img_gimi_viewer_text>>.

A slightly more advanced version of web-gimi-viewer displays the same metadata on a map interface, as shown in <<img_gimi_security_metadata>>.

The sprint participants noted that from a web browser perspective the tools and libraries needed included an ISOBMFF parser (e.g., mp4box.js), KLV+ST0601 parser (e.g., misb.js), XML decoder (built-in), TAI decoder, and image codecs (e.g., heif2any). The prototype web-gimi-viewer was implemented using the aforementioned libraries. A screenshot of the viewer is shown in <<img_gimi_viewer_1>>.

Web browsers have native support for a very limited number of image formats/codecs, and supporting additional codecs requires explicit effort in the web application. Support for the HVC1 codec could not be implemented due to time constraints, this being the reason why <<img_gimi_security_metadata>> displays an empty rectangle instead of the imagery.

By contrast, the file in <<img_gimi_viewer_1>> uses the HEIF codec, which can be decoded with the aid of the https://github.com/alexcorvi/heic2any[heic2any] library.
