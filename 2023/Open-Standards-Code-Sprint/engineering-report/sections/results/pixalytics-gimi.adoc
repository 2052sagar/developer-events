==== Testing Windows open source support for GIMI

This section presents findings of prototyping GIMI support within Windows using Python and open source libraries. The prototyping and assessment was carried out by Samantha Lavender.

The first part of the experiment was to try and read the metadata from within a GIMI files using Python. The GitHub repository was searched and the https://github.com/chemag/pyisobmff[pyisobmff] repository was found. This was forked and a https://github.com/pixalytics-ltd/pyisobmff/tree/OGC-code-sprint[branch] created so that testing and updates could be undertaken.

First, the Python code was updated so it ran for the example GIMI files. This required a change in one line, from extent to item:

Then, the next experiment focused on reading the images. For this, the https://www.libvips.org/[libvips] image processing library was tested. On Windows, pre-compiled DLLs are needed for the Python library https://pypi.org/project/pyvips/[pyvips], and they should be specified in the Windows Advanced System Settings control panel, or via the PATH in the Python code. The second approach was used:

--------------------------------------
import os
vipsbin = r'C:\DDrive\OGC-code-sprint\vips-dev-8.15\bin'
os.environ['PATH'] = vipsbin + ';' + os.environ['PATH']
--------------------------------------

However, by default, the compiled DLLs don't come with the support for the needed codec compression. Therefore, it was decided to recompile the DLLs following the option described in the https://github.com/libvips/build-win64-mxe#hevc-related-dependencies[build-win64-mxe] repository.

Through trial and error, it was found that the easiest way to compile the DLLs was to:

. Install Windows Docker Hub and link it to Ubuntu installed on a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

. Then, the bash script could be run, which downloads a Docker image, builds a libvips Docker image and then compiles all the DLLs required for pyvips:

./build.sh all --with-hevc

This allowed the HEIF and HEIC examples to be read, but not the HEJ2 sample. The next experiment undertaken, was to update build-win64-mxe to support HEJ2 as this is supported in the latest version of https://github.com/strukturag/libheif[libheif], but in the time available it was not achieved.

The code in the https://github.com/pixalytics-ltd/pyisobmff/tree/OGC-code-sprint[pixalytics pyisobmff branch] was updated to add an option, using the function extract_items, to read the images and output them as JPEG files:
