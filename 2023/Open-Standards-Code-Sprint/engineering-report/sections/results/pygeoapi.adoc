===== Implementation of a CSW Facade

The pygeoapi project implemented an OGC API - Records  https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1386[CSW Facade] plugin
as a means to bridge CSW implementations.  Note that support is bound to CSW 2/3 and the CSW Record core model (ISO 19115/19139
support can be implemented as future work).  This work was merged to the core pygeoapi codebase.

===== Support for Publish/Subscribe operations

A live demo was given which exemplified the capabilities of Pub/Sub as a workflow for metadata catalogue management, using the WMO
https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-gdc[WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogue Reference Implementation] (powered by pygeoapi).  In this demo,
the catalogue is subscribed to an MQTT broker which is publishing messages of new discovery metadata records.  On notification of
new metadata, the catalogue is triggered to validate and ingest the metadata into a metadata collection, thereby making it available
via OGC API - Records.
