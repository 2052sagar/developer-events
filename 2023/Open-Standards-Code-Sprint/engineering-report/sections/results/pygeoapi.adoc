===== Implementation of a CSW Facade

The pygeoapi project implemented an OGC API - Records  https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1386[CSW Facade] plugin
as a means to bridge CSW implementations.  Note that support is bound to CSW 2/3 and the CSW Record core model (ISO 19115/19139
support can be implemented as future work).  This work was merged to the core pygeoapi codebase.

A live demonstration was provide using the https://woudc.org[WMO World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC)] CSW server.

===== Support for Publish/Subscribe operations

A live demo was given which exemplified the capabilities of Pub/Sub as a workflow for metadata catalogue management, using the WMO
https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-gdc[WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogue Reference Implementation] (powered by pygeoapi).  In this demo,
the catalogue is subscribed to an MQTT broker which is publishing messages of new discovery metadata records.  On notification of
new metadata, the catalogue is triggered to validate and ingest the metadata into a metadata collection, thereby making it available
via OGC API - Records.

===== Support for the draft GIMI profile

Sprint participants from Geobeyond worked on the GIMI thread of the code sprint. Their goal was to implement the
ability to serve files using OGC API – Coverages and OGC API – Tiles capabilities offered by pygeoapi. An additional
goal was to enable a workflow that supports modification of the files. The libraries that they modified or
implemented for this work are available on the https://github.com/ricardogsilva/gimirrai[gimirrai repository on GitHub].

As an initial objective, they set out to see whether the https://github.com/strukturag/libheif[libheif] library, which
is commonly used by to read HEIF files, could be enabled to support reading and writing of GIMI files. libheif is used
by https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/heif.html[GDAL to provide support for HEIF], so the expectation was that it would
be possible to use Python to leverage GDAL's HEIF support via https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[rasterio].
However, upon testing libheif, they found that it does not support some of the needed capabilities specific to the
GIMI profile. This lack of support in libheif means that popular raster-handling tools based on GDAL are not by default
able to support GIMI files. Some modifications are thus required to enable such tools to support for the format.

With help from Brad Hards, they compiled a patched version of libheif that could read GIMI files. They then compiled
GDAL, https://pillow-heif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[pillow-heif] and rasterio to enable the reading of GIMI files
through Python, which was successful. Note that, even though they were now working with a version of libheif that was
able to read the sample GIMI files, and even though GDAL was now able to leverage libheif to provide read support,
GDAL still did not know how to read the sample GIMI files' georeferencing metadata, as this is stored in a KLV-encoded
bytestream, which is specific to GIMI.

The sprint participants were able to decode and parse the GIMI KLV bytestream by means of reading the GIMI files
with pillow-heif and then implementing a custom KLV bytestream parser. Although it did work OK, the implementation was
fairly low level, relying on knowledge of the https://nsgreg.nga.mil/doc/view?i=4152[MISB ST0601 standard] and on
decoding bytes to their corresponding types. Decoding KLV enabled them to review the geographic bounds declared in the
metadata of the GIMI files. The Figure below shows the geographic bounds of a sample GIMI file displayed on a pygeoapi
interface.

Afterwards, they sought to enable pygeoapi to support the reading of GIMI files, which would make it possible to serve
the imagery files through interfaces conforming to OGC API Standards.

The pygeoapi integration efforts relied upon its existing extensibility mechanism, whereby it is possible to write
custom providers and plug them in to dataset collections via configuration.

For OGC API – Coverages, they were able to write a custom provider inspired by the stock rasterio one. The GIMI provider
differed in the sense that instead of letting rasterio retrieve the geographical bounds transparently, via GDAL, it
needed to use the KLV bytestream parser mentioned above.

For OGC API - Tiles, implementation was a bit more involved. In order to leverage existing Python-based libraries
(which are usually using GDAL bindings) to generate tiles, GDAL would need to be able to properly recognize a GIMI
file's georeferencing metadata. The team was able to put together a solution that relied upon the
https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/vrt.html[GDAL Virtual Format (VRT)], together with the already mentioned custom KLV parser.
The VRT approach then unlocked the usage of the https://cogeotiff.github.io/rio-tiler/[rio-tiler] library, which is a
rasterio plugin that provides means to generate raster tiles. The final implementation was a pygeoapi provider that
tied all parts together, reading KLV metadata, then using a GDAL VRT definition to allow rio-tiler to be able to read
the sample GIMI files and generate tiles. As such, and for brevity, the implemented provider was simplified to:

* Basically serve tiles, the other OGC API related endpoints were not given much attention
* Support only the the familiar WebMercatorQuad tile matrix set
* Serve tiles in PNG format
* Generate tiles at runtime, without any caching strategy

The end result was then visualized on a simple leaflet-based web client, which used the pygeoapi endpoints to serve
tiles for sample GIMI files. The below figure shows a screenshot of a GIMI file displayed on a web map served by pygeoapi.

The final goal was implementing support for CRUD operations on GIMI files via a WEB API, leveraging OGC API standards.
Unfortunately this goal proved unattainable, as the team found substantial blockers and there was not enough time
during the code sprint to solve them.

An initial research showed that GDAL does not have support for creating HEIF files. So the plan was to use libheif
instead, by leveraging its existing Python bindings. However, none of the efforts related to using pillow-heif to
create or update one of the sample GIMI files was successful. Several attempts were made, by leveraging the different
https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Pillow] and pillow-heif capabilities, but they all ended abruptly due to
various lower-level errors. Having failed at being able to modify an existing GIMI file with the existing libraries,
the team could not move forward with the web and pygeoapi related aspects of the goal.

In conclusion, the team found that it is currently not very easy to work with GIMI files at the Python level.

* Reading and georeferencing GIMI files is possible, but requires a larger effort, especially when compared to common
geospatial file formats;
* Creating and updating existing GIMI files seems to not be possible, or at least not with the more popular tools used in
the Python ecosystem. Due to the complexity of the ISOBMFF and HEIF formats and the additional GIMI profile on top,
implementing a custom writer for GIMI files in Python would be a very resource-intensive task.

On a more positive note, because Python tools mostly depend on libheif and GDAL, if proper GIMI support would be added
to these lower-level libraries, working with GIMI files would become as easy as working with GeoTiff and the other
popular formats. Having this lower-level support in place would open up the possibility of using rasterio, rio-tiler and
other libraries with GIMI files in a transparent way. Additionally, pygeoapi proved to be a very flexible choice when
implementing OGC API-based servers, as it is easy to integrate custom bits of code.
