===== Facets extension of OGC API - Records

The code sprint was an excellent opportunity for developers to meet in person and advance the momentum on the facets proposal, which was initiated at the last OGC Code Sprint in Bussigny.

This subsection describes a proposal that aims to introduce a new extension to the OGC API - Records candidate Standard, facilitating a more straightforward understanding of dataset distribution across various criteria.

The term "Facet" here refers to a high-level piece of information computed over a set of records in a collection.

====== Work Achieved

The team successfully prepared a proposal for integrating the facets feature into the OGC API - Records candidate Standard. This proposal includes:

- Adding a new entry point `/facets` that returns predefined facets for the record. The concept is that the server administrator predefines a pool of facets that the client can use to represent the dataset distribution over certain fields.
- Specifying the different types of facets, their characteristics, and settings, including:
- Adding new parameters to the `/items` entry point to fetch facets alongside search results.

====== Definition of a Facet

A facet can be of several types:

- Terms facet

A `terms` facet can be applied to any text property and produces a list of values appearing for a specific
property across all matching records, as well as the count of records containing each value.

A terms facet based on `keyword` countries might return a list of buckets like so:

[%unnumbered%]
[source]
----
* Greece (24 records)
* Germany (12 records)
* England (5 records)
----

- Histogram facet

A `histogram` facet can be applied to any temporal or numeric property to distribute item values over ranges or intervals.

The facet `createDate` will return a list of buckets like so:

[%unnumbered%]
[source]
----
* 2020-01-01 to 2020-02-01: 18 records
* 2020-02-01 to 2020-03-01: 22 records
* 2020-03-01 to 2020-04-01: 43 records
----

- Filters facets

A `filters` facets produces a count of matching records for one or several predefined queries. This essentially
lets the user run "sub-queries" cheaply to have a better understanding of the composition of the search results.

[%unnumbered%]

----
* hasDownloads : 2051 records
* hasMaps : 11495 records

====== Discussions included

- Seeking validation from the OGC API - Records SWG to accept this new feature.
- Technical considerations
- Roadmap planning

====== Roadmap

- Subject to approval by the SWG, the proposal's PR should be finalized, reviewed, and merged.
- Subsequently, the team will focus on creating the extension definition resources.
- Simultaneously, an initial implementation will be carried out in GeoNetwork and pygeopi.
