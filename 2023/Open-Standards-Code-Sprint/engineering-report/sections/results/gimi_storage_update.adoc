==== Storage and update of GIMI files through a Web API

Ahead of the three-day code sprint, one of the objectives was to demonstrate the update and storage of GIMI files through the Create, Replace, Update, Delete (CRUD) approach adopted by other OGC API Standards. However due to limitations in the built-in capabilities of the Python ecosystem, it was not possible to implement the approach during the three-day code sprint. The experimentation conducted during the code sprint also highlighted that the OGC API - Processes Standard may be more appropriate for supporting the storage and update requirements. This is because OGC API - Processes allows for different types of payload to be submitted to an API. Therefore, following the three-day code sprint, OGC staff prototyped an approach that leverages the OGC API - Processes Standard to achieve both storage and update of GIMI files.

The prototype involved modifying the hello-world process that comes built into pygeoapi following the instructions on the https://opengeospatial.github.io/e-learning/wps/text/towards-ogc-api-processes.html#creating-an-ogc-api-processes-proxy-in-front-of-the-wps[OGC e-learning resource]. The process implemented by the prototype was called 'imagery-utils' and was designed to recieve a GIMI image encoded as a base64 string and then to store that image locally on the server.

To create a process in pygeoapi for storing an image through the OGC API - Processes interface, the first step is to clone and build pygeoapi by following the steps below. The steps are copied from the pygeoapi.io website.

python3 -m venv pygeoapi
cd pygeoapi
. bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi.git
cd pygeoapi
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
cp pygeoapi-config.yml example-config.yml
vi example-config.yml  # edit as required
export PYGEOAPI_CONFIG=example-config.yml
export PYGEOAPI_OPENAPI=example-openapi.yml
pygeoapi openapi generate $PYGEOAPI_CONFIG --output-file $PYGEOAPI_OPENAPI
pygeoapi serve
# in another terminal
curl http://localhost:5000  # or open in a web browser

The next step is to modify the example-config.yml file by adding the following process to the resources element.

    imagery-utils:
        type: process
        processor:

The next step is to add the following paths to the example-openapi.yml.

Then add the following to the root-level list of tags in example-openapi.yml.

- description: Imagery processing utilities

Thereafter, add the ImageryUtilities process to the plugin.py file as shown below.

----
    'process': {
        'ImageryUtilities': 'pygeoapi.process.imagery_utilities.ImageryUtilitiesProcessor'
    },
----

Thereafter copy and modify the file process/hello_world.py to create one called imagery_utilities.py. Within that file replace 'hello-world' with 'imagery-utils', 'HelloWorld' with 'ImageryUtilities', and 'hello_world' with 'imagery_utilities'. Most importantly the execute function should look as shown below.

        url_of_results = 'No results'

        output_filename = "savedimage"+str(time.time_ns())
        print(output_filename)

        fh2 = open("../storage/"+output_filename+".txt", "w")
        print(image_dataset)
        fh2.write(image_dataset)
        fh2.close()

        value = ' {}'.format(url_of_results).strip()


        outputs = {
            'id': 'result',
            'value': value
        }

        return mimetype, outputs

Thereafter, to start the application, run the following commands.

[source]

python3 setup.py install
pygeoapi serve
# in another terminal
curl http://localhost:5000  # or open in a web browser

To test the process, we can use Postman, curl, or any other HTTP client. Postman is an application that offers a Graphical User Interface for testing HTTP endpoints such as those provided by Web APIs. In contrast, curl offers some of the same capability but through a command line interface.

Now from the HTTP client such as Postman or curl, send the following request via POST to http://localhost:5000/processes/imagery-utils/execution

During the three-day code sprint, participants were able to implement tools for creating GIMI files. Multiple sample files were created as a result. However, due to time constraints, it was not possible to integrate the tools used for creating the GIMI files into a Web API.
