==== Hexagon Catalog Explorer

Sprint participants from Hexagon demonstrated their implementation of a client application for OGC API - Records. They demonstrated that the client application could access 3rd party catalogs served through implementations of OGC API - Records. One of the issues that they sought to resolve during the code sprint was the format and source of the thumbnails. For example, whether the thumbnails could be served by a WMS or OGC API - Maps implementation. Following the code sprint, the issue was discussed by the SWG and https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/316#issuecomment-1808377763[consensus reached].
