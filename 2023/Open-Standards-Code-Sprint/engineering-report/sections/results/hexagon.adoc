Sprint participants from Hexagon demonstrated their implementation of a client application for OGC API - Records. The demonstrated that the client application could access 3rd party catalogs served through implementations of OGC API - Records. Once of the issues that they sought to resolve during the code sprint was the format and source of the thumbnails. For example, whether the thumbnails could be served by a WMS or OGC API - Maps implementation.
