==== GIMI web-map client

Sprint participants prototyped a client application, called geo-heif-viewer, for displaying HEIF files containing geographical data (according to the GIMI profile). Development of geo-heif-viewer helped to identify a number of issues relating to GIMI. One of those issues was that there are records of metadata in various parts of a GIMI file, and each record of metadata uses a different encoding. This is illustrated in <<img_gimi_metadata_encodings>>. The four records of metadata in different encodings therefore require four different tools to be parsed, and thus four different blocks of code (which duplicates effort and cost).

Another issue that was identified by the sprint participants was that some of the processing could be performed on either the server or the client. This therefore leads to the question of which would be the optimal strategy for handling a GIMI file. <<img_gimi_data_pipeline>> shows *some* of the libraries that sprint participants worked with to support the reading and writing of GIMI files at different stages of the workflow.

The sprint participants noted that from a web browser perspective the tools and libraries needed included an ISOBMFF parser (e.g. mp4box.js), KLV+ST0601 parser (e.g. misb.js), XML decoder (built-in), TAI decoder, and image codecs (e.g. heif2any). The prototype geo-heif-viewer was implemented using the aforementioned libraries. A screenshot of the viewer is shown in <<img_gimi_viewer_1>>.

A screenshot showing security and TAI (timestamp) metadata retrieved from a GIMI image is shown in <<img_gimi_security_metadata>>.
