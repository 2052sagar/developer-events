=== GIGS 

The GIGS tests can be found on the gigs.iogp.org website. The participants from Geomatys worked on https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-JNI[PROJ-JNI] to enable it to execute additional GIGS tests. PROJ is a coordinate transformation software package, built using C/C++ library, that transforms geospatial coordinates from one CRS to another. PROJ-JNI is a Java Native Interface for PROJ.

Not every software product will support every feature that the GIGS tests specify, so a properties file is provided to enable the user to enable or disable specific aspects of the tests. PROJ-JNI is an implementation of the OGC GeoAPI Standard.

=== Maplibre

The rendering pipleline is generally not exposed to the user. So the participants working on Maplibre experimented with accessing the rendering pipeline. They implemented functionality to export the depth buffer (shown in the top left of <<img_maplibre_discussion>>). The approach offers the ability to create light effects and special environmental effects such as an atmospheric haze (shown in the bottom right of <<img_maplibre_discussion>>). So the participants configured their prototype so that when the viewing point is far away the effect is disabled. The participants also examined other parts of the pipeline so that any object that is rendered is based on the modified depth buffer. This included for example modification of the coordinate buffer (shown in the bottom left of <<img_maplibre_discussion>>) so that tiles at the top of the screen represent a large space. The third aspect that can be modified using this approach is the color of the image, for example to enable a user to adjust the brightness or to create aesthetic visuals (shown in the top right of <<img_maplibre_discussion>>).
