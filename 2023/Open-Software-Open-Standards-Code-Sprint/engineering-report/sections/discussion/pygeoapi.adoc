=== pygeoapi

The pygeoapi work involved integration with a new data provider to expose scientific and ocean data from a specific API.Implementation of the new data provider had been done prior to the code sprint, and some final integration work had been completed during the code sprint. The data provider was enabled to access ERDDAP, a server technology by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA). ERDDAP is used by several of NOAA's partners to disseminate real time scientific data. Servers supporting ERDDAP can be accessed through an interface that support JSON messages, as well as other approaches. The sprint participants working on pygeoapi wanted to expose an ERDDAP instance through an interface that implements the OGC API - Features Standard.

In the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group (DWG) there is interest in establishing an OGC API approach for Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) operations. This is because alerts have to be sent out instantly when severe weather events occur. Members of the MetOcean DWG have been developing a Discussion Paper on Pub/Sub operations, which was presented at the OGC Member Meeting in Frascati in February 2023. It is envisaged that the Discussion Paper will lead to the specification of a conformance class in OGC API - EDR that can also be used by other OGC API Standards as well.

The Discussion Paper describes a number approaches of how to support event-driven functionality in OGC API Standards. The Discussion Paper specifies a prototype API. The next step is turning that prototype into a conformance class. The basic premises behind the specification is to be generic. The specification recommends use of AsyncAPI to adertise an event-driven capability. The specification also recommends use of a well-known encoding, for example JSON. Finally, the specification recommends use of the endpoint of the building blocks used for OGC API when you advertising the event-driven capability. 

An implementation of the prototype, which has been built using pygeoapi, was demonstrated during the code sprint. The demo assumes that there is a data provider upstream that is producing observations from which the alerts are derived. From there the alerts are created and pusshed into an implementation of https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html[OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete]. The OGC API - Features implementation sends a message to a broker. In addition to the features being inserted into the collection, a notificaiton would then be sent out to subscribers.
The implementation uses a broker called Mosquito, which supports MQTT. The client application was implemented using OWSLib.

The landing page of the pygeoapi instance was modified to enable it to advertise links to both the OpenAPI definition document and the AsyncAPI definition document. <<img_pygeoapi_landing>> shows a screenshot of the landing page of a pygeoapi instance that advertises both an OpenAPI and an AsyncAPI definition document.

An extract of the JSON-encoding of the landing page is shown in the following listing. The advertisement of the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI definition documents in the same landing page highlighted the need to have a way to distinguish between the two types of links. OGC API Standards use `rel` and `type` link-params (link parameters) to describe the type of resource that is referenced by a link. Therefore there is a need for a media type that uniquely identifies an AsyncAPI document that is encoded in JSON. This issue was https://posted on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/issues/329[OGC API - Common issues board] and also on the https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/936[AsyncAPI issues board]. Also related to this issue is the need to be able to uniquely distinguish between an HTML-encoded API defintion document that is based on OpenAPI and one that is based on AsyncAPI. This second issue was https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/issues/330[posted] on the OGC API - Common repository.

Accessing the HTML-encoded AsyncAPI definition document, leads to a view such as the one shown in <<img_pygeoapi_asyncapi_html>>. Note that the document advertises an MQTT server. In addition to MQTT, AsyncAPI also supports other protocols like Kafka and AMQP.

Subscription information can be obtained from the description of a feature collection that supports the event-driven mechanism. An example link for subscribing to notifcations through MQTT is shown in the following listing.

The listing above highlights a need to be able to include additional parameters in links. Since https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8288/[RFC 8288] identifies a specific set of link-params that are allowed in links, this raises the question of whether inclusion of the channel parameter would be allowable per the RFC. If the RFC does not allow additional parameters, then how might the need to advertise channel endpoints be addressed in a future Pub/Sub conformance class of OGC API Standards? These questions were https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/issues/331[posted] to the OGC API - Common repository for discussion by the SWG. A screenshot of MQTT Explorer receiving notifications from an OGC API - Features implementation is presentted in <<img_pygeoapi_mqtt_explorer>>. http://mqtt-explorer.com/[MQTT Explorer] is an MQTT client that displays an overview of MQTT topics and supports other tasks involving MQTT.

The experimentation is envisaged to contribute to development of the WIS2 framework by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). A screenshot of a WIS 2.0 prototype receiving notifications through the Pub/Sub mechanism is shown in <<img_wis2>>.
