=== IOGP GIGS tests and the OGC GeoAPI Standard

The Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software (GIGS) tests are an open-source digital testing framework for evaluating the capability of software in establishing and maintaining the integrity of geospatial data. The tests are developed and mainted by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP). The GIGS tests can be found on the https://gigs.iogp.org[gigs.iogp.org] website. 

The participants from Geomatys worked on https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-JNI[PROJ-JNI] to enable it to execute additional GIGS tests. PROJ is a coordinate transformation software package, built using C/C++ library, that transforms geospatial coordinates from one CRS to another. PROJ-JNI is a Java Native Interface for PROJ.

Not every software product will support every feature that the GIGS tests specify, so a properties file is provided to enable the user to enable or disable specific aspects of the tests. PROJ-JNI is an implementation of the OGC GeoAPI Standard.
