=== GIGS 

The GIGS tests can be found on the gigs.iogp.org website. The participants from Geomatys worked on https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-JNI[PROJ-JNI] to enable it to execute additional GIGS tests. PROJ is a coordinate transformation software package, built using C/C++ library, that transforms geospatial coordinates from one CRS to another. PROJ-JNI is a Java Native Interface for PROJ.

Not every software product will support every feature that the GIGS tests specify, so a properties file is provided to enable the user to enable or disable specific aspects of the tests. PROJ-JNI is an implementation of the OGC GeoAPI Standard.
