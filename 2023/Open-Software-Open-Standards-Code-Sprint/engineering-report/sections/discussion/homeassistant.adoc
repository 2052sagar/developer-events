=== Home Assistant and OGC SensorThings API

HomeAssistant-SensorThings was introduced during the code sprint. The sprint participants implemented an ability for HomeAssistant-SensorThings to automatically and periodically fetch observations from an instance of the OGC SensorThings API. The software was also enabled to offer automatic discovery of 'Things' as HomeAssistant devices and 'Datastreams' as HomeAssistant sensors.

One of the challenges encountered was that there is some inconsistency in units of measurement between specific implementations of the OGC SensorThings API. This issue is explained further by <<img_homeassistant_discussion>> which shows in Panel 1 an implementation that uses `degC`, and in Panels 2 an implementation that uses `Â°C` and in Panel 3 an implementation that uses `C` to represent temperature in degree Celsius. It is also worth noting the difference in the values of the definition properties in the implementations shown in Panels 2 and 3. This difference could be mistakenly interpreted to mean that the observed properties are semantically different. This issue could potentially be addressed by providing examples of the use of OGC Rainbow (formerly known as the OGC Definitions Server) to support the representation of units of measure in sensor-related standards.

Another observation was although the data type of the definition property is supposed to be a URI, a number of the implementations appeared not to specify URIs in this property. The sprint participants therefore recommended the creation and maintenance of a taxonomy of well-known observable properties, including their JSON representations containing URIs. Such a capability could, for example, be implemented as an extension of OGC Rainbow.

Another observation was that there was no indication of the rate of observation. This means it becomes unclear for some client applications how long they should wait before retrieving the next observation. The absence of an indicator of the rate of observation is partly because SensorThings API uses a publish/subscribe mechanism through MQTT and thus does not rely on polling. However, not all client applications support MQTT. The participants noted that OGC API - Records has a resolution property that helps client applications determine how often to request observations.

The sprint participants also noted that there is no shorthand for fetching the last observation. The participants noted that although such a query could be constructed using ODATA query options like `?$top=1&$orderby=phenomenonTime desc`, such a capability would have to be implemented with caution because some constrained devices might not be able to support querying of very large data collections.

A content-type negotiation mechanism that enables a client application to retrieve content in HTML, JSON, or another language was also noted as a potential enhancement for the SensorThings API standard.
