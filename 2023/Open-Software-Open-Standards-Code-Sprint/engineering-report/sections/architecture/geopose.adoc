==== OGC GeoPose


OGC GeoPose is an OGC Implementation Standard for exchanging the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (Poses) within reference frames anchored to the earthâ€™s surface (Geo) or within other astronomical coordinate systems. GeoPose specifies a single encoding in JSON format (IETF RFC 8259). The use cases addressed by GeoPose involve interactions between information systems or between an information system and a storage medium. The role of a GeoPose is to convey the orientation and position of a real or virtual object.
