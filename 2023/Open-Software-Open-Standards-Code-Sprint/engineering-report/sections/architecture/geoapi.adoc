==== OGC GeoAPI

https://www.geoapi.org/[OGC GeoAPI 3.0.2] is an OGC Standard provides a set of programming interfaces for geospatial applications.
The GeoAPI interfaces closely follow the abstract models published by OGC and ISO specifications.
The current release covers interfaces for metadata handling and for geodetic referencing (map projections).
The GeoAPI interfaces provide a layer which separates client code, which call the API, from library code, which implements the API.
This follows a similar pattern to the well known JDBC or ODBC API which provides a standardized interface to databases.
Clients can use the API without concern for the particular implementation which they will use.
