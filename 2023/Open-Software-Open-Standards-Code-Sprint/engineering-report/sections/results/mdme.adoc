==== MDME

The MDME project uses https://koumoul-dev.github.io/vuetify-jsonschema-form[vjsf] internally to render a web based metadata edit form derived from a json schema. A visual edit form for MCF has proven to be useful in yaml oriented metadata workflows for some user groups. Some json schema concepts such as `any-of` are not supported by vjsf. During the code sprint MDME was updated to prevent the use of `any-of` and selector patterns having '*'. Also during the code sprint, import of metadata from ISO 19139 records (as discussed in this https://github.com/OSGeo/mdme/issues/20[GitHub Issue]) and export to ISO 19139 records was introduced, as well as export to STAC and OGC API - Records collections (based on a transformation service provided by pygeoapi/pygeometa).
