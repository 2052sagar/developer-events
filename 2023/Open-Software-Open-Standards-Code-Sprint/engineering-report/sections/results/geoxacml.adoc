==== OGC GeoXACML

===== Purpose

Secure Dimensions implemented the GeoXACML 3.0 draft specification based
on the https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Authzforce CE] project which is an Open Source Community Edition project by https://www.fiware.org/[FIWARE]. The implementation is based on Java 11 and will be made available as the Open Source reference implementation for GeoXACML 3.0.
The implementation of a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) during the code sprint was important for testing the GeoXACML 3.0 GeoPDP reference implementation by Secure Dimensions
regarding request and response processing.

===== Solution

With respect to implementation, a GeoServer deployment including the
default data was used as the API to be protected. From the
GeoServer architecture, different possibilities exist where to place the
PEP. For the code sprint, the solution to deploy a https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] Filter was
favored. This ensured that the GeoServer installation could almost remain
unchanged. The configuration of the “web.xml” could be adopted to
include the “WFS Filter for GeoXACML 3.0”. Also, the filter’s JAR (Java Archive) file and
dependencies must be added to “geoserver.war” (the web application archive that is deployed inside Apache Tomcat).

The implementation of the WFS Filter itself used the Authzforce
XACML-SDK for Java that needs to be extended to allow the inclusion of
Geometry attributes. The actual access condition to exclude all features
of the Central Park was modelled in a GeoXACML 3.0 Policy. This was made
possible by constructing an Obligation on Permit that returns the OGC
Filter condition that the PEP needs to apply to the intercepted request.

===== Achievement

During the Code Sprint, a demonstration was implemented that follows the XACML
flow diagram shown in <<img_xacml_flow_diagram>>.

A GeoServer 2.23 WAR-file deployment was used create the WFS 2.0 service
endpoint.

The injection of the PEP was done by updating the “geoserver.war” file
manually

* zip -u geserver.war WEB-INF/web.xml
* zip -u geoserver.war WEB-INF/lib/GeoXACMLFilter.jar

The web.xml file contains the deployment for the WFS Filter for GeoXACML
3.0.

During the code sprint, one bug concerning the processing of XML
attributes was fixed.

===== Demonstration
The focus during the code sprint was to demonstrate the ability to
rewrite WFS requests to reflect geospatial access control decisions. In
order to achieve that, a simple GeoXACML 3.0 policy was crafted using
ALFA for Visual Studio Code (ALFA plugin).

The GeoXACML 3.0 policy is structured in a simple way:

* PolicySet (Manhattan) matches “service == WFS”
* Policy (POLY_LANDMARKS) matches “typesNames == tiger:poly_landmarks”
* Rule (CENTRAL_PARK) matches “request == GetFeature”
* The Rule Condition contains is geospatial “BBOX Intersects Polygon(…)”

Any request that matches the condition results in the decision “Permit”
with the Obligation “urn:secd:filter”. As specified in the XACML 3.0
specification, a PEP must enforce the decision including all
obligations. The processing of this filter obligation provides the
missing information to construct the WFS Filter (disjoint Central Park).

The result of this processing can be visualized with QGIS (WFS Layer):

[[img_poly_landmarks]]
.Left: Feature type “poly_landmarks” without PEP -> Central Park feature(s) are included; Right: Feature type “poly_landmarks” with PEP -> Central Park feature(s) are excluded!
image::../images/poly_landmarks.png[image,width=601,height=292]

The implementation of the Filter obtains the information from the HTTP
request:

===== Lessons Learned

The Tomcat Filter implementation was based on Java 11. The existing
XACML-SDK for Java was available for Java 8. Due to deprecation of javax
classes in Java 11, JAXB related functionality had to be updated. The
use of GeoTools to create the Filter programmatically could not be
achieved. The unresolved problem was that the XML encoder did not
include the CRS into the GML part of the spatial filter. Examples and
documentation was found to only cover non-spatial examples or the BBOX Filter.
But for implementing the use case, a Disjoint filter with a GML3
geometry had to be constructed. After removing GeoTools completely, a
simple string template was used:
“<fes:OPERATION><fes:ValueReference>the_geom</fes:ValueReference>GEOMETRY</fes:
OPERATION >” where the GEOMETRY was constructed from the response by the
PDP (Obligation attributes urn:secd:filter:geometry and
urn:secd:filter:operation).

===== Follow-Up

The OGC API - Features endpoint was not used as it is not yet possible to pass a
Filter parameter. Once the Filter capability is standardized in OGC
API - Features - Part 3, the implementation for this demonstration could be
adopted accordingly. The implementation would need to be adopted to
obtain relevant information such as the feature-type, the request BBOX,
etc. according to OGC API - Features.
