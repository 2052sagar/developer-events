==== OSGeo ZOO-Project

The ZOO-Project worked on moving forward https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project/wiki/OSGeoIncubationLandingPage[OSGeo Incubation]
as well as the https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AIncubation+sort%3Aupdated-desc[remaining tasks] as part of the https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project/wiki/ProjectGraduationChecklist[Project Graduation Checklist] to become an OSGeo project. Discussion with other participants regarding https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-009.html[OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining] led to some initial work on ZOO Project's support for this candidate standard.
