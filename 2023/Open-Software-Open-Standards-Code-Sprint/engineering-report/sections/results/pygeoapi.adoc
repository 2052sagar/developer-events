==== OSGeo pygeoapi

The pygeoapi project completed the https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1214[implementation] of a
feature provider for the ERDDAP data server. https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html[ERDDAP]
is a data server that provides a simple, consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets in
common file formats, graphs, and maps. This new pygeoaopi feature was created by WMO as part of the
https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int project and has been promoted to be included in the pygeoapi core.

An https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1230[update] was also made in pygeoapi to highlight licensing when available as part of a collection definition's link object (where `+rel=license+`).

The pygeoapi project implemented the draft https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/pull/1230[OGC API - Pub/Sub conformance class of OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval standard] (see also the original https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=103606[discussion paper (23-013)]).

Using OWSLib support for OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update, and Delete, the workflow entailed
publishing new features via transactions which then triggered push notifications via the MQTT protocol.  Pub/Sub
capabilities were made available via the AsyncAPI specification leveraging the OGC API endpoints as subscription channels.
