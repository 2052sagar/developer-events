==== OSGeo GeoServer

The GeoServer team worked remote focusing on seperating our implementation into individually downloadable modules. This work is required in anticpation of cql2 being finalized enabling the first public release of a GeoServer ogcapi module.

* Pull-reqeust (merged) splitting ogcapi implementation into individual downloads
* Pull-request (merged) nightly build docker image allowing public testing of ogcapi modules above

We also checked in with the status of CQL2 which reqmains under active development. We are waiting on this activity before publishing our ogcapi-features module for the general public.
