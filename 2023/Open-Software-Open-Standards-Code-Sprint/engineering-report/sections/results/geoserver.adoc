==== OSGeo GeoServer

The GeoServer team focused on separating the implementation into individually downloadable modules. This work is required in anticipation of CQL2 being finalized and enabling the first public release of a GeoServer ogcapi module that supports OGC API Standards.

Some of the outputs included:

* a https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/6801[pull reqeust] splitting ogcapi module implementation into individual downloads;
* a pull request of a nightly build docker image allowing public testing of ogcapi modules above; and
* a https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/6802[pull request] providing fixes to the OGC API - Tiles implementation, based on the draft CITE tests for it.

The GeoServer maintainers also checked in with the status of CQL2 which remains under active development and are waiting on this activity before publishing the ogcapi-features module (supporting OGC API - Features) for the general public.
