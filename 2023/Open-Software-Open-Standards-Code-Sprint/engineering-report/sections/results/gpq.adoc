==== GPQ

The GQP source was recently open sourced, and is now available under the Planet Labs GitHub organization: https://github.com/planetlabs/gpq.  A CI workflow was added to publish a WASM binary of the utility to GitHub Pages, allowing conversion of GeoJSON to GeoParquet and vice versa https://planetlabs.github.io/gpq/[in the browser].  In addition, work was done to improve how the Parquet schema is derived from GeoJSON features.  Previously, the schema would be derived from the first feature in a collection with all non-null property values.  Now, the schema is incrementally built over a range of features, allowing for a more complete schema to be derived.  This is especially useful for large collections with sparse properties.
