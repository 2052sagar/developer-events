==== AsyncAPI

The maintainers of pygeoapi worked on support for AsyncAPI. A discussion of the pygeoapi results is presented in <<pygeoapi_discussion>>. The landing page of the pygeoapi instance was modified to enable it to advertise links to both the OpenAPI definition document and the AsyncAPI definition document. <<img_pygeoapi_landing>> shows a screenshot of the landing page of a pygeoapi instance that advertises both an OpenAPI and an AsyncAPI definition document.

An extract of the JSON-encoding of the landing page is shown in the following listing. The advertisement of the OpenAPI and AsyncAPI definition documents in the same landing page highlighted the need to have a way to distinguish between the two types of links. OGC API Standards use `rel` and `type` link-params (link parameters) to describe the type of resource that is referenced by a link. Therefore there is a need for a media type that uniquely identifies an AsyncAPI document that is encoded in JSON. This issue was https://posted on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/issues/329[OGC API - Common issues board] and also on the https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/936[AsyncAPI issues board]. Also related to this issue is the need to be able to uniquely distinguish between an HTML-encoded API defintion document that is based on OpenAPI and one that is based on AsyncAPI. This second issue was https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/issues/330[posted] on the OGC API - Common repository.
