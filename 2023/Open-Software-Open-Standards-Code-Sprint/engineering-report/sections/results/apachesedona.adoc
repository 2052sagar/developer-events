==== Apache Sedona

Apache Sedona leverages a number of open-source libraries, including GeoTools, to execute some spatial operations. However, as an Apache project, Sedona is striving to reduce
its reliance on GeoTools due to licensing issues. In order to address this
challenge, Sedona is migrating affected functions to Apache SIS.

In this code sprint, sedona maintainers concentrated on replacing GeoTools' usage in
two key functions within Sedona: ST_Transform and the GeoTiff reader. Their focus was on demonstrating how to migrate these functions to Apache SIS, providing a comprehensive tutorial on the necessary steps involved.
