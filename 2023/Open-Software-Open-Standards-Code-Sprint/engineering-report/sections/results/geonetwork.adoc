== Support for OGC API Records in GeoNetwork-UI

Work in progress by https://github.com/fgravin[@fgravin] and https://github.com/jahow[@jahow].

This aims at :

. creating an abstraction level between the search-related components of GeoNetwork-UI and the actual search backend used for metadata records
. implement a search backend compatible with OGC API Records services

Eventually, this means a GeoNetwork-UI application such as the https://github.com/geonetwork/geonetwork-ui/tree/main/apps/datahub[Datahub] could be able to
provide a search interface over any OGC API Records service. Some features currently provided by GeoNetwork 4.x might not be available anymore, but
basc search functionalities should still offer a valuable user experience.
